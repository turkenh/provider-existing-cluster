# Stack-GCP

## Overview

This `stack-gcp` repository is the implementation of a Crossplane infrastructure
[stack](https://github.com/crossplaneio/crossplane/blob/master/design/design-doc-stacks.md) for
[Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com).
The stack that is built from the source code in this repository can be installed into a Crossplane control plane and adds the following new functionality:

* Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) that model GCP infrastructure and services (e.g. [CloudSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/), [GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/), etc.)
* Controllers to provision these resources in GCP based on the users desired state captured in CRDs they create
* Implementations of Crossplane's [portable resource abstractions](https://crossplane.io/docs/master/running-resources.html), enabling GCP resources to fulfill a user's general need for cloud services
